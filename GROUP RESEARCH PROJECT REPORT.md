## Executive Summary
...

## Introduction
**Context:**
As part of the research team at EduAnalytics Lab, we are investigating the factors that influence student success in higher education. With the rise of digital tools and changing learning environments, traditional study methods are evolving. Universities need data-driven insights to design better academic support systems.

**Research Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between **study habits** (time management, use of digital tools, study environment) and **academic performance** (self-reported GPA/grades).

**Research Question:**
Does the use of modern digital tools and structured time management strategies correlate with higher academic performance among university students?

## Methodology
**Research Design:**
We adopted a quantitative research approach using a cross-sectional survey design. This method was selected to identify patterns and correlations across a student population efficiently.

**Data Collection:**
* **Instrument:** An online questionnaire was designed using Google Forms.
* **Sampling:** We used convenience sampling, targeting university students across different majors.
* **Sample Size:** N = 36 valid responses.
* **Timeline:** Data was collected in November 2025.

**Data Analysis:**
The raw data was exported to CSV format and cleaned (anonymized) for analysis. We used descriptive statistics to understand the demographics and comparative analysis to test our hypothesis regarding study habits and grades.
