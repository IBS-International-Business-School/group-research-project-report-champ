[ChatGPT 5.0] was used to [brainstorm themes and structure] for this group research project report on [topic]. Prompt: '...' No AI-generated text is included in the final submission. Accessed: [Date]. Available at: https://chat.openai.com/.

We have retained a complete set of raw data, including questionnaires (papers completed by hand or record downloaded from the online survey platform), recordings, and/or transcripts of interviews, secondary data, etc., as well as data analysis files and documents. 

## Executive Summary
This study aims to investigate the relationship between college students' learning habits and their academic performance. We surveyed 36 students via an online questionnaire covering five core dimensions: time management, self-regulated learning, digital tool usage, group learning dynamics, and review strategies. Data analysis revealed that effective time management, high self-regulated learning ability, efficient use of digital tools, and active participation in group learning were significantly positively correlated with GPA. Among these, self-regulated learning ability emerged as the strongest predictor of academic performance. Based on these findings, we recommend that educators and student affairs departments prioritize promoting time management workshops, metacognitive strategy courses, and digital literacy training. These initiatives will systematically help students cultivate efficient learning habits, thereby enhancing overall academic outcomes.

## Introduction
**Context:**
As part of the research team at EduAnalytics Lab, we are investigating the factors that influence student success in higher education. With the rise of digital tools and changing learning environments, traditional study methods are evolving. Universities need data-driven insights to design better academic support systems.

**Research Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between **study habits** (time management, use of digital tools, study environment) and **academic performance** (self-reported GPA/grades).

**Research Question:**
Does the use of modern digital tools and structured time management strategies correlate with higher academic performance among university students?

## Methodology
**Research Design:**
We adopted a quantitative research approach using a cross-sectional survey design. This method was selected to identify patterns and correlations across a student population efficiently.
Basic Information: Demographic data including gender, age, educational stage, weekly study hours, and self-rated academic performance.
Time Management: Assesses study planning and procrastination tendencies (e.g., “I create weekly study plans and strictly adhere to them”).
Self-Regulated Learning: Measures metacognitive strategies (e.g., regularly evaluating comprehension, proactively seeking learning resources).
Digital Tool Usage: Investigates the use of digital tools (Notion, Quizlet, etc.) and their impact on academic performance.
Group Study Dynamics: Examines group study preferences, effectiveness, and individual contribution levels.
Review Strategies: Assess review lead time and application of active review techniques, while collecting qualitative data on effective strategies and learning motivation.
Beyond basic information and open-ended questions, core items employ a five-point Likert scale (1 = “Strongly Disagree” to 5 = “Strongly Agree”).

**Data Collection:**
* **Instrument:** An online questionnaire was designed using Google Forms.
* **Sampling:** We used convenience sampling, targeting university students across different majors.
* **Sample Size:** N = 36 valid responses.
* **Timeline:** Data was collected in November 2025.

**Data Analysis:**
The raw data was exported to CSV format and cleaned (anonymized) for analysis. We used descriptive statistics to understand the demographics and comparative analysis to test our hypothesis regarding study habits and grades.

## Discussion
This study confirms that self-regulation ability and effective review strategies are key predictors of academic achievement. This aligns with Zimmerman's (2002) self-regulated learning theory, emphasizing the importance of proactive planning and monitoring of the learning process. Additionally, positive group learning dynamics correspond with Doo et al.'s (2020) findings that collaborative learning promotes knowledge deepening.
Notably, the correlation between digital tool usage and academic performance was relatively weak, indicating that technology itself is not a decisive factor—its effectiveness depends on how it is integrated into individual learning systems.
Research limitations include: potential selection bias from convenience sampling; the cross-sectional design's inability to establish causality; and possible social desirability bias in self-reported data.



## Recommendations
Based on the research findings, we propose the following tiered recommendations:

**Student Level**:
- Focus on developing self-regulation skills by enhancing learning process monitoring through methods such as maintaining study journals
- Actively adopt active review techniques, such as utilizing tools like Quizlet for practice quizzes

**School Level**:
- Prioritize offering learning strategy workshops to systematically train time management and metacognitive skills
- Incorporate group collaboration components into course design and integrate digital learning tools appropriately

**Research Level**:
- Employ longitudinal research designs to clarify causal relationships between learning habits and academic performance
- Conduct in-depth investigations into how specific application patterns of digital tools impact learning outcomes

## Reflection on Team Process
Sprint Planning: Break down the project into four sprint phases: literature review, data collection, data analysis, and report writing.
GitHub Collaboration: Track tasks by creating Issues, work independently on feature branches, and ensure merge quality through Pull Requests and code reviews.
Team Collaboration: Hold biweekly video stand-up meetings to synchronize progress and promptly adjust distribution strategies when data collection encounters obstacles, demonstrating the team's adaptability.
